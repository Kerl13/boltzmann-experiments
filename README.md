# Some experiments on Boltzmann sampling

This repository is a playground for testing and comparing different possible
implementations (in OCaml) of some core components of Boltzmann samplers. This
*quick* experimental study is meant to guide implementation choices in
[Arbogen](https://github.com/fredokun/arbogen).
